					The biggest mistake Airbnb hosts make is limiting themselves and solely
					relying on the Airbnb platform. Airbnb fees can take their toll – those
					3% (+VAT) host service fees start to add up, and there’s no knowing if
					these fees will increase as your property grows even bigger.
					<br />
        Why stick to only one platform when you can have your listing on my
        website for absolutely free!

					We provide a review section that serves to bolster your airbnb
					recommendations and bookings you will recieve on other booking sites
					hosting your listing. Hosting your airbnb on our site serves to add even
					more traffic to the existing traffic.
					<br />
        It goes without saying: the more and better reviews your Airbnb listings
        have, the more likely you are to attract guests!
